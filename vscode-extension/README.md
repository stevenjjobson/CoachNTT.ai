## Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts       # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/         # Command handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/        # VSCode providers (tree views, etc.)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Utilities (logger, etc.)
```

### Safety-First Design

All displayed information is automatically abstracted:
- File paths: `<project>/<module>/<file>`
- URLs: `<url>` or `<api_endpoint>`
- IPs: `<ip_address>`
- Tokens/Keys: `<token>`
- UUIDs: `<uuid>`
