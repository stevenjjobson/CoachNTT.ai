# Voice Command Framework Design

## Architecture Overview

The Voice Command Framework integrates with the existing audio infrastructure to enable natural language control of VSCode through voice commands.

### Core Components

#### 1. Voice Command Service (`voice-command-service.ts`)
- Central coordinator for voice command processing
- Manages command lifecycle from transcription to execution
- Integrates with AudioCaptureService for input
- Integrates with AudioPlaybackService for feedback

#### 2. Command Parser (`command-parser.ts`)
- Natural language processing for command extraction
- Intent recognition and parameter extraction
- Fuzzy matching for command variations
- Context-aware parsing

#### 3. Command Registry (`voice-command-registry.ts`)
- Stores available voice commands
- Maps intents to VSCode actions
- Manages command aliases and variations
- Provides command discovery

#### 4. Command Router (`command-router.ts`)
- Routes parsed commands to appropriate handlers
- Manages execution context (editor, file, selection)
- Handles command confirmation and cancellation
- Provides undo/redo support

#### 5. Voice Feedback Service (`voice-feedback-service.ts`)
- Text-to-speech responses
- Audio cues for command states
- Visual feedback coordination
- Error message handling

## Command Grammar

### Basic Command Structure
```
[trigger] [action] [target] [parameters]
```

Examples:
- "Go to line 42"
- "Find function handleConnect"
- "Open file extension.ts"
- "Replace all var with const"

### Command Categories

#### 1. Navigation Commands
- `go to line [number]`
- `go to function [name]`
- `go to definition`
- `go back`
- `find [text]`
- `find next`
- `find previous`

#### 2. File Operations
- `open file [name]`
- `close file`
- `save file`
- `save all`
- `new file`
- `rename file to [name]`

#### 3. Editor Commands
- `select line [number]`
- `select word`
- `select all`
- `copy`
- `paste`
- `cut`
- `undo`
- `redo`

#### 4. Code Modification
- `comment line`
- `uncomment line`
- `format document`
- `indent`
- `outdent`
- `replace [text] with [text]`

#### 5. Extension-Specific
- `connect to backend`
- `show memories`
- `play audio`
- `stop recording`
- `show monitoring`

## Integration Points

### 1. Audio Capture Integration
```typescript
// Listen to transcription events
audioCaptureService.on('transcriptionComplete', (result) => {
    voiceCommandService.processTranscription(result);
});
```

### 2. VSCode Command Execution
```typescript
// Execute parsed commands
vscode.commands.executeCommand(commandId, ...args);
```

### 3. Context Detection
```typescript
// Get editor context
const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
const selection = editor?.selection;
const document = editor?.document;
```

### 4. Feedback Integration
```typescript
// Provide audio feedback
audioPlaybackService.synthesizeAndPlay("Command executed");
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Session 2.3.1)
1. Create VoiceCommandService
2. Implement basic CommandParser
3. Build VoiceCommandRegistry
4. Create CommandRouter
5. Setup VoiceFeedbackService

### Phase 2: Basic Commands
1. Implement navigation commands
2. Add file operation commands
3. Create editor commands
4. Test and refine parsing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Context-aware commands
2. Multi-step commands
3. Command macros
4. Custom commands

## Error Handling

### Recognition Errors
- "I didn't understand that command"
- Suggest similar commands
- Show command help

### Execution Errors
- "Cannot execute command in this context"
- Provide specific error details
- Suggest alternatives

### Ambiguity Resolution
- "Did you mean X or Y?"
- Show options to user
- Learn from corrections

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Parser accuracy tests
- Command matching tests
- Context detection tests
- Error handling tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end command flow
- Audio pipeline integration
- VSCode API integration
- Performance tests

### User Acceptance Tests
- Command recognition accuracy
- Response time measurements
- User satisfaction metrics
- Edge case handling

## Performance Considerations

### Command Processing
- Target: < 100ms parsing time
- Async processing for complex commands
- Caching for frequent commands

### Memory Usage
- Lazy load command definitions
- Dispose unused resources
- Monitor memory footprint

### Responsiveness
- Non-blocking UI updates
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Cancelable operations

## Security Considerations

### Command Validation
- Sanitize file paths
- Validate command parameters
- Prevent injection attacks

### Permission Checks
- Respect VSCode permissions
- Check file access rights
- Validate workspace boundaries

### Audit Trail
- Log command executions
- Track command sources
- Monitor for anomalies

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning
- Learn user command patterns
- Improve recognition accuracy
- Personalized command shortcuts

### Natural Language Understanding
- Support complex queries
- Handle conversational commands
- Context carryover between commands

### Multi-language Support
- Internationalization framework
- Language-specific parsers
- Localized feedback messages
