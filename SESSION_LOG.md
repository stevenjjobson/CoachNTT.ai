## Session 0.1: Core Safety Principles & Architecture
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Document core safety principles in `docs/safety/PRINCIPLES.md`
- [x] Create abstraction pattern catalog in `docs/safety/PATTERNS.md`
- [x] Define reference validation rules in `docs/safety/VALIDATION.md`
- [x] Design temporal safety mechanisms
- [x] Create safety-first directory structure
- [x] Implement AbstractionEngine base class
- [x] Implement ReferenceExtractor for concrete reference detection
- [x] Implement PatternGenerator for creating abstractions
- [x] Implement SafetyValidator for validation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite
- [x] Set up Docker environment with PostgreSQL + pgvector
- [x] Create initial database migration (000_safety_foundation.sql)

### Key Decisions:
- Minimum safety score: 0.8 (enforced at all levels)
- Placeholder format: `<name>` syntax
- Python 3.10 compatibility (can upgrade later)
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector 0.5.1

### Metrics:
- Files created: 25+
- Test coverage: 3 test suites with 40+ tests
- Database tables: 9 safety-related tables
- Safety patterns: 9 seed patterns loaded

### Notes for Next Session:
- Database is containerized and ready
- Safety schema exists but needs enforcement triggers
- All Python components tested and working
- Ready for Session 0.2: deeper database integration

## Session 0.2: Safety Database Schema
**Date**: 2025-01-13  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Created 001_safety_enforcement.sql migration
- [x] Implemented validation triggers:
  - `enforce_abstraction_before_insert` - Validates abstractions exist
  - `validate_reference_safety` - Ensures proper abstractions
  - `prevent_concrete_exposure` - Blocks concrete references
  - `comprehensive_audit_trail` - Logs all operations
- [x] Added row-level security (RLS) policies:
  - Read-only access to failed validations
  - No updates to validated abstractions
  - No deletion of audit records
  - Access control based on safety scores
- [x] Created advanced check constraints:
  - Minimum abstraction score 0.8
  - Validation log consistency
  - Required severity for conflicts
- [x] Implemented temporal safety functions:
  - `identify_stale_references()` - Find outdated refs
  - `check_temporal_safety()` - Validate age
  - `detect_reference_drift()` - Track pattern changes
- [x] Created comprehensive test suites:
  - SQL test suite (test_safety_enforcement.sql)
  - Python integration tests (test_database_safety.py)
- [x] **Checkpoint**: Safety schema deployed with enforcement

### Key Decisions:
- Error codes: SA001-SA004 for different safety violations
- RLS policies enforce read-only for failed validations
- Audit logging captures all DML operations
- Temporal checks default to 24-hour validation window

### Metrics:
- Triggers created: 6
- RLS policies: 12 (6 tables √ó 2 policies each)
- Check constraints: 3 new
- Helper functions: 8
- Test cases: 15+

**Duration**: [Estimated 2-3 hours]  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started

### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Review existing abstraction implementation from Session 0.1
- [ ] Enhance abstraction rules for all reference types
- [ ] Add validation pipeline for memories
- [ ] Create safety metrics collection
- [ ] Build abstraction quality scorer
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Implement caching layer

- [ ] Test abstraction pipeline thoroughly
- [ ] **Checkpoint**: Abstraction framework ready

### Context Files Needed:
- Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 108-131)
- src/core/abstraction/ (all files)
- src/core/validation/validator.py
