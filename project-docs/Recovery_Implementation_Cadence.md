# üîÑ Recovery Implementation Cadence: Reality-First Development

---
**Title**: Recovery from Documentation Drift with Reality-Based Development  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Purpose**: Systematic recovery from feature sprawl using verified progress  
**Core Principle**: Document Reality, Not Aspirations (Safety Law 6)

## üìã Current Reality Assessment

### What We Claimed vs What Exists
| Claimed | Reality | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 320 tests written | 167 tests exist, 10 working | Grep count, compilation errors |
| 45MB memory optimized | 45MB database-only test | No API or features included |
| Voice framework complete | Structure exists, 0 integration | No MCP connection tested |
| 60% test coverage target | ~6% actual (10/167) | Most tests won't compile |

### Rollback Decision
- **Target**: Session 2.1.4 (WebView Foundation)
- **Reason**: Last known stable state with basic functionality
- **Method**: Git reset --hard with full backup

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase R0: Foundation Recovery (Week 1)

### Session R0.1: Backup and Rollback (2 hours)
**Reality Check**: Can we run the extension without errors?

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create backup branch: `git checkout -b backup/pre-rollback-2025-01-19`
- [ ] Commit all current work with honest message about state
- [ ] Tag current state: `git tag -a v0.2.3-broken -m "167 tests, 10 working"`
- [ ] Find Session 2.1.4 commit: `git log --grep="Session 2.1.4"`
- [ ] Reset to stable point: `git reset --hard <commit>`
- [ ] Verify extension activates: `npm run compile && code --extensionDevelopmentPath=.`
- [ ] Document actual features that work in REALITY_CHECK.md
- [ ] **Reality Checkpoint**: Extension runs for 5 minutes without crash

**Success Criteria**:
- Extension compiles without errors
- Can open VSCode with extension
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Basic commands visible

### Session R0.2: Test Infrastructure Reality (3 hours)
**Reality Check**: Can we run ANY test successfully?

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Remove all node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- [ ] Create single smoke test that MUST pass:
  ```typescript
  test('Extension can activate', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true); // Start with absolute minimum
  });
  ```
- [ ] Run test: `npm test`
- [ ] If fails, fix test infrastructure until this passes
- [ ] Add one real test: extension activation
- [ ] Document exactly what's required to run tests
- [ ] Create TEST_REALITY.md with actual test counts
- [ ] **Reality Checkpoint**: 2 tests passing

**Success Criteria**:
- npm test executes without errors
- At least 1 meaningful test passes
- Test output shows clear pass/fail
- No "claimed but not verified" tests

---

## üîß Phase R1: Core Verification (Week 2)

### Session R1.1: Memory Operations Reality (3 hours)
**Reality Check**: Can we actually store and retrieve a memory?

**Prerequisites**: 
- [ ] Tests running (Phase R0.2)
- [ ] Extension activating

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write test FIRST: "Can create memory via command"
- [ ] Run test (it should fail)
- [ ] Implement minimum code to pass test
- [ ] Write test: "Can retrieve created memory"
- [ ] Implement retrieval
- [ ] Write test: "Tree view updates on memory creation"
- [ ] Implement tree refresh
- [ ] Update docs with ACTUAL memory capabilities
- [ ] **Reality Checkpoint**: Can demo create/read memory

**Success Criteria**:
- 5+ memory tests passing
- Can manually create and view memory
- Tree updates visible in UI
- No claims beyond tested features

### Session R1.2: MCP Connection Reality (3 hours)
**Reality Check**: Does the WebSocket actually connect and stay connected?

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write test: "MCP client connects to localhost"
- [ ] Write test: "Connection stays alive for 60 seconds"
- [ ] Write test: "Reconnects after disconnect"
- [ ] Implement only what's needed to pass tests
- [ ] Document ACTUAL connection reliability
- [ ] Remove any "will support" language
- [ ] Create metrics with context: "Connected for X seconds with Y messages"
- [ ] **Reality Checkpoint**: 10 minute stable connection

**Success Criteria**:
- WebSocket connects and maintains connection
- 5+ connection tests passing
- Clear metrics on connection stability
- No untested protocol claims

---

## üöÄ Phase R2: Feature Restoration (Week 3+)

### Session R2.X Template: Single Feature Reality
**One Feature Per Session - No Exceptions**

**Feature Selection Criteria**:
1. Has clear user value
2. Can be tested in isolation
3. No dependencies on untested features
4. Can be demoed in 1 minute

**Session Structure**:
- [ ] Write 5 tests for the feature (before coding)
- [ ] Implement minimum to pass tests
- [ ] Manual testing for 30 minutes
- [ ] Update docs with reality:
  - What actually works
  - What doesn't work
  - Performance with context
  - Known limitations
- [ ] **Reality Checkpoint**: Demo to someone else

**Prohibited**:
- Adding "while we're here" features
- Claiming future support
- Skipping tests
- Moving to next feature if tests fail

## üìä Reality Tracking System

### Weekly Reality Audit Template
```markdown
## Week X Reality Audit

### What We Claimed This Week
- [ ] List all documentation claims made

### What Actually Works
- [ ] Features that pass all tests
- [ ] Metrics with full context
- [ ] Actual vs claimed test counts

### Documentation Corrections Needed
- [ ] Overstatements to fix
- [ ] Missing context to add
- [ ] Aspirational content to mark

### Next Week Reality Goals
- [ ] Specific, testable objectives
- [ ] No more than 3 items
```

### Metrics Template
```markdown
## Performance Metrics (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)

**Test Environment**:
- Features loaded: [list exactly what's running]
- Test duration: [how long]
- Test scenario: [what was actually tested]

**Results**:
- Memory: XMB (with [list of active features])
- Response time: Xms (for [specific operation])
- Test coverage: X/Y tests passing (Z tests exist but don't run)

**NOT Tested**:
- [List features assumed but not verified]
- [List scalability assumptions]
```

## üéØ Success Definition

### Phase Completion Requires
1. All tests in phase passing
2. 1-hour stability test passed
3. Documentation reflects reality
4. Someone else can run your demo
5. No "will work when" statements

### Project Recovery Milestones
- [ ] Month 1: Core functions with honest docs
- [ ] Month 2: One additional feature fully tested
- [ ] Month 3: Reality audit shows 0 false claims

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Feature Creep**: "While I'm fixing tests, let me add..."
2. **Test Theater**: Writing tests after claiming feature complete
3. **Metric Gaming**: Testing minimal case and extrapolating
4. **Documentation Drift**: Not updating docs when reality changes
5. **Aspiration Addiction**: "This will support..." statements

---

## ‚úÖ Recovery Principles

1. **Reality Over Velocity**: Slow truth beats fast fiction
2. **Test-First Always**: No code without failing test
3. **Context Always**: Every metric includes test conditions
4. **Demo-Driven**: If you can't demo it, it's not done
5. **Honest Retrospectives**: What we claimed vs what we built

---

## üìù Template Usage

Each session:
1. Copy session template
2. Set reality checkpoint
3. Work until checkpoint passes
4. Update documentation with reality
5. Commit with honest message
