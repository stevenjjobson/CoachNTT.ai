# 🛡️ Safety Principles

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. Abstraction-First
- **All concrete references must be abstracted**
- Minimum safety score: 0.8
- Placeholder format: `<placeholder_name>`
- No concrete file paths, IDs, or personal data

### 2. Validation at Every Layer
- Database-level enforcement
- Application-level validation
- API-level safety checks
- Real-time monitoring

### 3. Fail-Safe Defaults
- System refuses unsafe operations
- Graceful degradation when safety checks fail
- Comprehensive error logging
- Alert on safety violations

### 4. Privacy by Design
- No personal information stored in concrete form
- Semantic abstractions preserve meaning
- Time-based data degradation
- Audit trail for all operations

## Safety Metrics
- **Quality Score**: >0.8 required
- **Processing Time**: <2ms target
- **Detection Rate**: 100% coverage
- **False Positives**: <1%

## Validation Pipeline
1. **Structure Validation**: Check input format
2. **Abstraction Validation**: Verify all references abstracted
3. **Safety Validation**: Confirm safety score threshold
4. **Temporal Validation**: Check time-based constraints
5. **Consistency Validation**: Verify data consistency

## Implementation Guidelines
- Build safety into foundation, not as afterthought
- Test safety first, features second
- Monitor safety metrics continuously
- Document safety decisions and trade-offs
