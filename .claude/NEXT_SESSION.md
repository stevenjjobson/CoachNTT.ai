- ‚úÖ Integration endpoints (checkpoint, vault sync, documentation generation)
- ‚úÖ Background task management with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive Pydantic models and validation
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for graph, integration, and WebSocket functionality
- ‚úÖ Safety-first design with zero-tolerance for concrete references

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: CLI Framework Enhancement (40% of session)
1. Enhance existing script framework for interactive CLI
2. Add command parser with subcommands and options
3. Implement configuration management for CLI settings
4. Add interactive mode with command completion
5. Create help system and command documentation

### Phase 2: Memory Management CLI (30% of session)
1. CLI commands for memory operations
2. `coachntt memory create` - Create new memories
3. `coachntt memory search` - Search memories with filters
4. `coachntt memory list` - List recent memories
5. `coachntt memory export` - Export memories to various formats

### Phase 3: Graph and Integration CLI (30% of session)
1. CLI commands for graph operations
2. `coachntt graph build` - Build knowledge graphs
3. `coachntt graph query` - Query graphs with filters
4. `coachntt graph export` - Export graphs to files
5. `coachntt sync vault` - Trigger vault synchronization
6. `coachntt docs generate` - Generate documentation

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Files to Create
- `cli/` directory structure for CLI components
- `cli/__init__.py` - CLI module initialization
- `cli/main.py` - Main CLI entry point with argument parsing
- `cli/commands/` - Command modules directory
- `cli/commands/__init__.py` - Command exports
- `cli/commands/memory.py` - Memory management commands
- `cli/commands/graph.py` - Graph operation commands
- `cli/commands/integration.py` - Integration commands (vault, docs)
- `cli/config.py` - CLI-specific configuration
- `cli/utils.py` - CLI utility functions (formatting, output)

### Files to Enhance
- Create `coachntt.py` in project root as main CLI entry point
- Update `scripts/framework/runner.py` if needed for CLI integration
- Add CLI dependencies to requirements if needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All CLI output must be abstracted before display
- [ ] Input validation must prevent concrete reference injection
- [ ] File operations must validate paths and permissions
- [ ] API calls must use proper authentication
- [ ] Error messages must be safely abstracted

## üìä Performance Targets

### CLI Performance (Session 4.2)
- **Command Response**: <2s for most operations
- **Memory Search**: <500ms for filtered results
- **Graph Operations**: <3s for build, <1s for query
- **File Operations**: <1s for export/import
- **Interactive Mode**: <100ms command completion

### Quality Metrics
- **Command Coverage**: All major API operations accessible via CLI
- **Help Documentation**: Complete help for all commands
