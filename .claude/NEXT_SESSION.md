- ✅ ConnectionFinder with semantic, temporal, and pattern analysis
- ✅ Non-directive filtering ensuring user autonomy
- ✅ Safety-first design with mandatory abstraction (≥0.8 safety score)
- ✅ Performance targets met (<200ms intent, <500ms connections)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with performance benchmarks

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core ASTAnalyzer (40% of session)
1. Create `src/core/analysis/ast_analyzer.py` - Main AST analysis engine
2. Implement language detection (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
3. Add Python AST parsing with comprehensive node handling
4. Create function signature extraction and documentation

### Phase 2: Pattern Detection (30% of session)
1. Implement design pattern detection (Singleton, Factory, Observer)
2. Add complexity metric calculation (cyclomatic, cognitive)
3. Create dependency graph builder for code relationships
4. Integrate with intent system for context-aware analysis

### Phase 3: Code Understanding (20% of session)
1. Add JavaScript/TypeScript basic parsing support
2. Create code structure analysis for classes and functions
3. Implement variable scope and usage tracking
4. Build code quality assessment framework

### Phase 4: Testing & Integration (10% of session)
1. Write comprehensive AST parsing tests on sample codebases
2. Test pattern detection accuracy across different code styles
3. Create integration tests with intent and memory systems
4. Validate safety abstraction for code analysis results

## 🛡️ Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All code analysis must abstract concrete references (file paths, URLs, etc.)
- [ ] Function/variable names abstracted to preserve privacy
- [ ] No storage of actual code content - only abstracted analysis results
- [ ] Pattern detection respects abstraction boundaries
- [ ] Complexity metrics don't reveal sensitive implementation details
- [ ] Dependency analysis abstracts external library references

## 📊 Performance Targets

### AST Analysis Performance
- **Target**: <300ms for Python file analysis (up to 1000 lines)
- **Pattern Detection**: <150ms for design pattern identification
- **Complexity Calculation**: <100ms for complexity metrics
- **Language Detection**: <50ms for file type identification

### Quality Metrics
- **Pattern Detection Accuracy**: >90% for common patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer)
- **Complexity Accuracy**: ±5% variance from established tools
- **Language Detection**: >95% accuracy for supported languages
- **Safety Validation**: Zero tolerance for concrete reference leakage
