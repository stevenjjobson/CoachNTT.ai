2. Add subgraph extraction and filtering capabilities
3. Create graph visualization generation commands
4. Add interactive HTML output with D3.js integration
5. Update living documentation with graph command examples

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Files to Create
- `cli/` directory structure for CLI components
- `cli/__init__.py` - CLI module initialization
- `cli/main.py` - Main CLI entry point with argument parsing
- `cli/commands/` - Command modules directory
- `cli/commands/__init__.py` - Command exports
- `cli/commands/memory.py` - Memory management commands
- `cli/commands/graph.py` - Graph operation commands
- `cli/commands/integration.py` - Integration commands (vault, docs)
- `cli/config.py` - CLI-specific configuration
- `cli/utils.py` - CLI utility functions (formatting, output)

### Files to Enhance
- Create `coachntt.py` in project root as main CLI entry point
- Update `scripts/framework/runner.py` if needed for CLI integration
- Add CLI dependencies to requirements if needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All CLI output must be abstracted before display
- [ ] Input validation must prevent concrete reference injection
- [ ] File operations must validate paths and permissions
- [ ] API calls must use proper authentication
- [ ] Error messages must be safely abstracted

## üìä Performance Targets

### CLI Performance (Session 4.2)
- **Command Response**: <2s for most operations
- **Memory Search**: <500ms for filtered results
