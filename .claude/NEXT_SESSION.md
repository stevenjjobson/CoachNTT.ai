- ‚úÖ Real-time context monitoring with system performance and safety score tracking
- ‚úÖ Automated vault sync integration with existing VaultSyncEngine
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test execution framework with coverage reporting and safety validation
- ‚úÖ Performance targets achieved (<2s script execution, <5s checkpoint analysis, <10s vault automation)

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All vault content must abstract concrete references (file paths, personal info, etc.)
- [ ] Memory content abstracted before markdown conversion
- [ ] No storage of actual sensitive data - only abstracted memory content
- [ ] Template processing respects abstraction boundaries
- [ ] Backlink generation abstracts concrete memory references
- [ ] Conflict resolution maintains abstraction integrity

## üìä Performance Targets

### Vault Sync Performance
- **Target**: <500ms for memory-to-markdown conversion (up to 100 memories)
- **Template Processing**: <200ms for template variable substitution
- **Conflict Detection**: <300ms for change comparison
- **Backlink Resolution**: <100ms for link generation

### Quality Metrics
- **Conversion Accuracy**: >95% fidelity for memory-to-markdown conversion
- **Template Accuracy**: 100% variable substitution success
- **Conflict Resolution**: >90% automatic merge success rate
- **Safety Validation**: Zero tolerance for concrete reference leakage in vault
