- Safety Framework: Abstraction quality scores, validation failures
- Background Tasks: Task queue status, completion rates, error tracking
- System Resources: CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Metrics & Health Checks (25% of session)
1. Set up Prometheus metrics collection
2. Add custom metric collectors for safety and performance
3. Implement health check endpoints for all services
4. Create performance tracking for critical paths
5. Add safety metrics monitoring (abstraction quality, validation rates)

### Phase 2: Monitoring Infrastructure (35% of session)
1. **Grafana Dashboards**:
   - System overview dashboard
   - API performance dashboard
   - Safety metrics dashboard
   - Database performance dashboard
2. **Alert Rules**:
   - Performance degradation alerts
   - Safety validation failure alerts
   - System resource alerts
3. **Log Aggregation**:
   - Structured logging with safety abstraction
   - Log parsing and analysis

### Phase 3: Observability Integration (25% of session)
1. Add tracing support for request flows
2. Implement performance profiling
3. Create monitoring for background tasks
4. Set up WebSocket connection monitoring
5. Add user behavior analytics (abstracted)

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (15% of session)
1. Configure monitoring stack in Docker
2. Create runbook documentation
3. Test alert mechanisms
4. Validate dashboard functionality
5. Document monitoring best practices

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Files to Create
- `src/services/monitoring/` - Monitoring service directory
- `src/services/monitoring/metrics.py` - Prometheus metrics collectors
- `src/services/monitoring/health.py` - Health check service
- `src/services/monitoring/tracing.py` - Distributed tracing setup
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` - Monitoring infrastructure
- `grafana/dashboards/` - Grafana dashboard definitions
- `grafana/provisioning/` - Grafana configuration
- `prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus configuration
- `alerts/rules.yml` - Alert rule definitions

### Files to Enhance
- Update `src/api/main.py` with health endpoints and metrics
- Enhance `docker-compose.yml` with monitoring services
- Add monitoring dependencies to `pyproject.toml`
- Update API routers with performance metrics

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All monitoring data must be abstracted (no concrete references in logs/metrics)
- [ ] Alert messages must use abstracted content only
- [ ] Dashboard visualizations must respect abstraction principles
- [ ] Tracing data must not expose concrete references
- [ ] Health check responses must use abstracted status information

## üìä Monitoring Targets

### Performance Monitoring Goals
- **API Response Times**: <500ms average for memory operations
- **Database Query Performance**: <100ms for safety validations
- **Safety Score Tracking**: Real-time abstraction quality monitoring
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU <70%, Memory <80%, Disk <90%
- **Error Rates**: <1% for API endpoints, 0% for safety violations

### Quality Metrics
- **Alert Response Time**: <1 minute for critical alerts
- **Dashboard Load Time**: <3 seconds for all dashboards
- **Metric Collection Overhead**: <5% system performance impact
- **Log Processing**: Real-time with <10 second delay
