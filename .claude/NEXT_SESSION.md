2. Add `coachntt docs generate` command for automated documentation creation
3. Implement `coachntt checkpoint create` command for development checkpoints
4. Enhance CLI engine with integration API methods
5. Add comprehensive validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Interactive CLI Mode (35% of session)
1. Implement `coachntt interactive` command with tab completion
2. Add command history and session management
3. Create built-in help system and command discovery
4. Integrate with existing commands for seamless experience
5. Add configuration and preference management

### Phase 3: CLI Polish and Completion (25% of session)
1. Add configuration management commands (`coachntt config`)
2. Implement advanced output formatting and themes
3. Add comprehensive testing and validation
4. Update documentation with complete feature coverage
5. Prepare for Phase 4 completion and final validation

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Files to Create
- `cli/` directory structure for CLI components
- `cli/__init__.py` - CLI module initialization
- `cli/main.py` - Main CLI entry point with argument parsing
- `cli/commands/` - Command modules directory
- `cli/commands/__init__.py` - Command exports
- `cli/commands/memory.py` - Memory management commands
- `cli/commands/graph.py` - Graph operation commands
- `cli/commands/integration.py` - Integration commands (vault, docs)
- `cli/config.py` - CLI-specific configuration
- `cli/utils.py` - CLI utility functions (formatting, output)

### Files to Enhance
- Create `coachntt.py` in project root as main CLI entry point
- Update `scripts/framework/runner.py` if needed for CLI integration
- Add CLI dependencies to requirements if needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Mandatory Safety Checks
- [ ] All CLI output must be abstracted before display
- [ ] Input validation must prevent concrete reference injection
- [ ] File operations must validate paths and permissions
- [ ] API calls must use proper authentication
- [ ] Error messages must be safely abstracted

## üìä Performance Targets

### CLI Performance (Session 4.2)
- **Command Response**: <2s for most operations
- **Memory Search**: <500ms for filtered results
- **Graph Operations**: <3s for build, <1s for query
