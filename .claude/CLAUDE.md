### 🔑 Key Design Decisions
1. **Mandatory Abstraction**: All concrete references must be abstracted (min score 0.8)
2. **Placeholder Format**: `<placeholder_name>` (configurable)
3. **Multi-stage Validation**: Input → Abstraction → Storage → Retrieval
4. **Database Enforcement**: Safety rules enforced at PostgreSQL level

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Run tests
./run_tests.py

# Connect to database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U ccp_user -d cognitive_coding_partner
```

## 📋 Next Session Plan

**For detailed session preparation, see:** [NEXT_SESSION.md](.claude/NEXT_SESSION.md)

### Quick Summary: Session 3.1 Obsidian Vault Sync
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 1-2 complete ✅, Sessions 2.2-2.4 complete ✅
- **Focus**: Implement memory-to-markdown conversion and bidirectional vault synchronization
- **Context Budget**: ~3000 tokens (clean window)
- **Estimated Output**: ~800-1000 lines

**Note**: Session 2.4 (AST Code Analysis) was completed with comprehensive code understanding and pattern detection capabilities.

## 📁 Pre-Session Structure Check

Before creating new files or directories:
1. **Check PRD Structure**: Review PROJECT_STRUCTURE_STATUS.md
2. **Verify Location**: Ensure files go in PRD-defined locations
3. **Document Deviations**: If diverging from PRD, document why
4. **Update Tracker**: Mark newly created structure in status doc

## 📊 Progress Tracking

## 📊 Context Management Protocol

### Session Start Protocol
When starting a session, I will provide:
- **Estimated Output**: Expected lines of code/documentation
- **Context Budget**: Percentage allocation of available window
- **Commit Points**: Clear checkpoints for saving progress

### Progress Indicators
- ✅ **Component Complete**: Major task finished
- 📊 **Context Update**: Current usage estimate
- 🎯 **Next Target**: What's coming next
- 💡 **Checkpoint Opportunity**: Good time to commit

### Context Estimation Guidelines
- **SQL Migrations**: ~500-800 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Python Code**: ~300-500 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Tests**: ~400-600 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Documentation**: ~200-300 lines per 1000 tokens

### Checkpoint Triggers
- **60% Usage**: Suggest commit checkpoint
- **80% Usage**: Switch to essential completion mode
- **Major Component**: Always suggest checkpoint opportunity

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Context Window**: Keep initial load under 3000 tokens
- **Progressive Loading**: Start minimal, load files as needed
- **Safety First**: Every feature must support abstraction from the start
- **No Retrofitting**: Build safety into foundation, not added later
- **Session Completion**: Always update NEXT_SESSION.md before final commit
