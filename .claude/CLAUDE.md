### üîë Key Design Decisions
1. **Mandatory Abstraction**: All concrete references must be abstracted (min score 0.8)
2. **Placeholder Format**: `<placeholder_name>` (configurable)
3. **Multi-stage Validation**: Input ‚Üí Abstraction ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Retrieval
4. **Database Enforcement**: Safety rules enforced at PostgreSQL level

### üöÄ Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Run tests
./run_tests.py

# Connect to database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U ccp_user -d cognitive_coding_partner
```

## üìã Next Session Plan

**For detailed session preparation, see:** [NEXT_SESSION.md](.claude/NEXT_SESSION.md)

### Quick Summary: Session 2.2.4 Advanced Code Analysis  
- **Prerequisites**: Session 2.2.3 complete ‚úÖ, Monitoring dashboard ready ‚úÖ
- **Focus**: Implement advanced code analysis features
- **Context Budget**: ~2600 tokens
- **Estimated Output**: ~850 lines

**Note**: Session 2.2.3 (Real-time Monitoring Dashboard) completed with dynamic memory scaling, Chart.js integration, and real-time WebSocket updates.

## üìÅ Pre-Session Structure Check

Before creating new files or directories:
1. **Check PRD Structure**: Review PROJECT_STRUCTURE_STATUS.md
2. **Verify Location**: Ensure files go in PRD-defined locations
3. **Document Deviations**: If diverging from PRD, document why
4. **Update Tracker**: Mark newly created structure in status doc

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Phase 1 (Complete)
- Phase 0: Safety Foundation [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100% (3/3 sessions) ‚úÖ
- Phase 1: Secure Foundation [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100% (4/4 sessions) ‚úÖ

- Phase 3: Knowledge Integration [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100% (4/4 sessions) ‚úÖ
- Phase 4: Integration & Polish [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100% (7/7 sessions: 4.1a ‚úÖ, 4.1b ‚úÖ, 4.2a ‚úÖ, 4.2b ‚úÖ, 4.2c ‚úÖ, 4.2d ‚úÖ, 4.3 ‚úÖ)

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
- Week 1-2: Foundation [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì] 100% (4/4 sessions) - Sessions 2.1.1 ‚úÖ, 2.1.2 ‚úÖ, 2.1.3 ‚úÖ, 2.1.4 ‚úÖ
- Week 3-4: Core Features [‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñì‚ñë] 75% (3/4 sessions) - Session 2.2.1 ‚úÖ, 2.2.2 ‚úÖ, 2.2.3 ‚úÖ
- Week 5: Voice Integration [‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 0% (0/4 sessions)
- Week 6: Polish & Advanced [‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 0% (0/3 sessions)

## üì¶ Deployment Target

### VPS Infrastructure
- **Provider**: HostSlinger VPS
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Resources**: 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB NVMe SSD, 8TB Bandwidth
- **Access**: SSH to `<vps_host>`
- **Docker**: Pre-installed and configured
- **Purpose**: Production deployment for Phase 2 backend services

### Deployment Strategy
- **Phase 2 Integration**: VSCode extension will connect to VPS-hosted services
- **Backend Services**: MCP server, REST API, WebSocket endpoints
- **Security**: SSL/TLS via Let's Encrypt, Nginx reverse proxy
- **Monitoring**: Grafana/Prometheus stack on VPS
- **Staging**: Local development ‚Üí VPS testing ‚Üí Production release

## üöÄ Phase 2: VSCode Extension & Voice Integration

### Overview
Phase 2 transforms CoachNTT.ai into a comprehensive IDE-integrated AI assistant with:
- **Rich VSCode UI**: Memory management, monitoring, and voice interaction
- **Voice Assistant**: Natural language interface for all operations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrated dashboards and alerts in IDE
- **VPS Backend**: Production services hosted on Ubuntu 24.04 server

### Key Objectives
1. Build VSCode extension with TypeScript and WebView UI
2. Implement voice command processing and synthesis
3. Create real-time monitoring dashboards
4. Deploy backend services to VPS for remote access
5. Maintain zero-tolerance safety in all UI components

### Session Structure (15 sessions over 6 weeks)
- **Sessions 2.1.1-2.1.4**: Extension foundation and MCP integration
- **Sessions 2.2.1-2.2.4**: Core features (audio, monitoring, WebSocket)
- **Sessions 2.3.1-2.3.4**: Voice integration and NLQ
- **Sessions 2.4.1-2.4.3**: Performance optimization and production readiness

## üìä Context Management Protocol

### Session Start Protocol
When starting a session, I will provide:
- **Estimated Output**: Expected lines of code/documentation
- **Context Budget**: Percentage allocation of available window
- **Commit Points**: Clear checkpoints for saving progress

### Progress Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Component Complete**: Major task finished
- üìä **Context Update**: Current usage estimate
- üéØ **Next Target**: What's coming next
- üí° **Checkpoint Opportunity**: Good time to commit

### Context Estimation Guidelines
- **SQL Migrations**: ~500-800 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Python Code**: ~300-500 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Tests**: ~400-600 lines per 1000 tokens
- **Documentation**: ~200-300 lines per 1000 tokens

### Checkpoint Triggers
- **60% Usage**: Suggest commit checkpoint
- **80% Usage**: Switch to essential completion mode
- **Major Component**: Always suggest checkpoint opportunity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Context Window**: Keep initial load under 3000 tokens
- **Progressive Loading**: Start minimal, load files as needed
- **Safety First**: Every feature must support abstraction from the start
- **No Retrofitting**: Build safety into foundation, not added later
- **Session Completion**: Always update NEXT_SESSION.md before final commit

## üìù Session Completion Protocol

### Mandatory End-of-Session Tasks
Before committing session completion, **ALWAYS** complete these steps:

1. **Update Session Status**:

   - [ ] Update context files list for next session requirements
   - [ ] Update prerequisites to include current session as complete

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - [ ] Document new capabilities and integration points
   - [ ] Update performance benchmarks if applicable
   - [ ] Record any architectural decisions or deviations

4. **Git Commit Requirements**:
   - [ ] Comprehensive commit message with session summary
