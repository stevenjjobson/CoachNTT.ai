# üöÄ Current Session Context

## Session Overview

**Current Focus**: Testing Foundation Catch-Up (CRITICAL)
**Last Completed**: Session 2.3.2 - Natural Language Query (NLQ)
**Next Session**: 2.3.2.5 - Testing Foundation
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PAUSED for critical testing - Addressing test coverage crisis before voice integration

## üö® Testing Priority Alert

**Critical Discovery**: Building voice integration on untested foundations
- Current test coverage: ~15% (Target: 90%)
- Audio services: 0 tests
- Voice command framework: Specifications only
- Risk: Cascading failures in voice pipeline

## Recent Achievements

### Session 2.3.2: Natural Language Query (NLQ)
- ‚úÖ Implemented NLQParser with natural language intent extraction
- ‚úÖ Created SemanticAnalyzer for concept mapping and query understanding
- ‚úÖ Built AST-based CodeSearchEngine with TypeScript compiler API
- ‚úÖ Developed QueryResultManager with navigation and voice feedback
- ‚úÖ Integrated NLQ with voice command framework
- ‚úÖ Added support for complex queries like "find all functions that handle authentication"
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test suites for all components
- üîß Integration with extension.ts still pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to connect to actual MCP transcription service

### Session 2.3.1: Voice Command Framework
- ‚úÖ Implemented complete voice command processing system
- ‚úÖ Created natural language parser with fuzzy matching
- ‚úÖ Built context-aware command router
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive voice feedback service
- ‚úÖ Defined 15+ command patterns across 6 categories
- ‚úÖ Created test specifications for all components
- üîß Integration with extension.ts pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical test coverage gap identified (5 tests for 30+ services)

### Session 2.2.5: Living Documents (.CoachNTT)
- ‚úÖ Implemented .CoachNTT file type support
- ‚úÖ Created minimal Living Documents service
- ‚úÖ Added automatic abstraction for documents
- ‚úÖ Integrated with memory system
- üîß Evolution tracking pending enhancement
- üîß Document preview panel needs completion

### Session 2.2.4: Advanced Code Analysis
- ‚úÖ AST parsing for TypeScript files
- ‚úÖ Pattern detection (long methods, god classes)
- ‚úÖ Complexity metrics with CodeLens
- ‚úÖ Code insights WebView panel
- ‚úÖ Real-time analysis on file save

### Session 2.2.3: Monitoring Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Real-time metrics visualization
- ‚úÖ Dynamic memory threshold scaling
- ‚úÖ Chart.js integration
- ‚úÖ WebSocket subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Export functionality

## Current Tasks

### Immediate Actions (Session 2.3.2.5)
1. ‚úÖ Document testing phase in Living Documents
2. Run backend smoke tests
3. Test VSCode extension activation
4. Verify audio pipeline end-to-end
5. Test MCP WebSocket stability
6. Achieve 60% coverage on critical paths

### Testing Focus Areas
- **Backend**: API health, database connections, safety validation
- **Extension**: Activation, MCP client, memory tree display  
- **Audio Pipeline**: VAD ‚Üí Capture ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Playback
- **Integration**: WebSocket pub/sub, memory CRUD operations

### Deferred to Post-Testing (Session 2.3.3)
- Connect AudioCaptureService to MCP transcription API
- Integrate transcription results with NLQ parser
- Create voice-to-text feedback loop
- Wire up all services in extension.ts

## Key Decisions & Patterns

### Living Documents Design
- Minimal integration approach
- Reuse existing infrastructure
- Automatic safety abstraction
- Context-aware compaction

### WebView Architecture
- Centralized panel management
- Type-safe message protocol
- CSP security enforcement
- Theme-aware styling

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for tree views
- 60-second cache TTL
- Debounced file analysis
- Efficient WebSocket usage

## Context Window Status

**Current Usage**: ~15% of available context
**Recent Load**: Living Documents implementation
**Optimization**: Good headroom for next session

## Integration Points

### Active Connections
- MCP WebSocket client operational
- Memory tree provider displaying
- Monitoring dashboard updating
- Code analysis on save events

### Pending Integrations
- Voice commands into extension.ts
- Natural language query processing
- Code search with voice
- Command discovery UI

## Development Environment

### Current Setup
- VSCode extension running locally
- Backend API on localhost:8000
- PostgreSQL with test data
- WebSocket connections active

### Tools in Use
- TypeScript strict mode
- Webpack dev server
- F5 debugging active
- Chrome DevTools for WebViews

## Notes & Observations

### Performance
- WebView load times <500ms
- Message round-trip <50ms
- Tree refresh <100ms
- All targets being met

### Safety Compliance
- All paths abstracted in UI
- Zero concrete references
- Safety score maintained >0.8
- Validation working correctly
- **TRA Fix Applied**: Temporal data now exempt from abstraction

### Critical Discoveries
1. **Temporal Reference Abstraction (TRA) Issue**
   - Abstraction system was interfering with AI temporal reasoning
   - Caused incorrect dates (January vs July 2025)
   - Fixed with minimal temporal exemption patterns

2. **Test Coverage Crisis** üö®
   - Only 5 test files for 30+ services
   - Audio services completely untested before voice integration
   - Major technical debt accumulating
   - **Decision**: PAUSE development for testing catch-up

3. **Voice Command Architecture Success**
   - Clean separation of parsing, registry, routing, and feedback
   - Fuzzy matching provides good user experience
   - Context validation prevents invalid command execution
   - Event-driven design allows easy monitoring and debugging

4. **Testing Timeline Assessment**
   - Significantly past appropriate testing start point
   - Building voice on untested audio foundation is high risk
   - 1-2 days of testing now saves weeks of debugging later
   - Critical for voice UX where failures are immediately obvious

### Areas for Enhancement
- Test coverage urgently needed
- Documentation updates needed
- Error handling improvements
- Auto-save conflict resolution needed

## Quick Actions
