# üöÄ Current Session Context

## Session Overview

**Current Focus**: Phase 2 VSCode Extension - Voice Integration
**Last Completed**: Session 2.3.1 - Voice Command Framework
**Next Session**: 2.3.2 - Natural Language Query (NLQ)
**Status**: Voice command framework complete, ready for NLQ integration

## Recent Achievements

### Session 2.3.1: Voice Command Framework
- ‚úÖ Implemented complete voice command processing system
- ‚úÖ Created natural language parser with fuzzy matching
- ‚úÖ Built context-aware command router
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive voice feedback service
- ‚úÖ Defined 15+ command patterns across 6 categories
- ‚úÖ Created test specifications for all components
- üîß Integration with extension.ts pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical test coverage gap identified (5 tests for 30+ services)

### Session 2.2.5: Living Documents (.CoachNTT)
- ‚úÖ Implemented .CoachNTT file type support
- ‚úÖ Created minimal Living Documents service
- ‚úÖ Added automatic abstraction for documents
- ‚úÖ Integrated with memory system
- üîß Evolution tracking pending enhancement
- üîß Document preview panel needs completion

### Session 2.2.4: Advanced Code Analysis
- ‚úÖ AST parsing for TypeScript files
- ‚úÖ Pattern detection (long methods, god classes)
- ‚úÖ Complexity metrics with CodeLens
- ‚úÖ Code insights WebView panel
- ‚úÖ Real-time analysis on file save

### Session 2.2.3: Monitoring Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Real-time metrics visualization
- ‚úÖ Dynamic memory threshold scaling
- ‚úÖ Chart.js integration
- ‚úÖ WebSocket subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Export functionality

## Current Tasks

### Immediate Actions
1. Begin Session 2.3.2 - Natural Language Query
2. Integrate voice commands into extension.ts
3. Address critical test coverage gaps
4. Create command discovery UI

### Session 2.3.2 Preparation
- Design NLQ processing pipeline
- Plan code search integration
- Create semantic understanding system
- Prepare AST integration for code queries

## Key Decisions & Patterns

### Living Documents Design
- Minimal integration approach
- Reuse existing infrastructure
- Automatic safety abstraction
- Context-aware compaction

### WebView Architecture
- Centralized panel management
- Type-safe message protocol
- CSP security enforcement
- Theme-aware styling

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for tree views
- 60-second cache TTL
- Debounced file analysis
- Efficient WebSocket usage

## Context Window Status

**Current Usage**: ~15% of available context
**Recent Load**: Living Documents implementation
**Optimization**: Good headroom for next session

## Integration Points

### Active Connections
- MCP WebSocket client operational
- Memory tree provider displaying
- Monitoring dashboard updating
- Code analysis on save events

### Pending Integrations
- Voice commands into extension.ts
- Natural language query processing
- Code search with voice
- Command discovery UI

## Development Environment

### Current Setup
- VSCode extension running locally
- Backend API on localhost:8000
- PostgreSQL with test data
- WebSocket connections active

### Tools in Use
- TypeScript strict mode
- Webpack dev server
- F5 debugging active
- Chrome DevTools for WebViews

## Notes & Observations

### Performance
- WebView load times <500ms
- Message round-trip <50ms
- Tree refresh <100ms
- All targets being met

### Safety Compliance
- All paths abstracted in UI
- Zero concrete references
- Safety score maintained >0.8
- Validation working correctly
- **TRA Fix Applied**: Temporal data now exempt from abstraction

### Critical Discoveries
1. **Temporal Reference Abstraction (TRA) Issue**
   - Abstraction system was interfering with AI temporal reasoning
   - Caused incorrect dates (January vs July 2025)
   - Fixed with minimal temporal exemption patterns

2. **Test Coverage Crisis**
   - Only 5 test files for 30+ services
   - Audio services completely untested before voice integration
   - Major technical debt accumulating

3. **Voice Command Architecture Success**
   - Clean separation of parsing, registry, routing, and feedback
   - Fuzzy matching provides good user experience
   - Context validation prevents invalid command execution
   - Event-driven design allows easy monitoring and debugging

### Areas for Enhancement
- Test coverage urgently needed
- Documentation updates needed
- Error handling improvements
- Auto-save conflict resolution needed

## Quick Actions

```bash
# Check current extension status
code vscode-extension

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Run extension tests
cd vscode-extension && npm test

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
