## 🎯 Meta-Analysis Guidelines

Every 3 section transitions, perform meta-analysis:

1. **Trend Analysis**: Are we getting more efficient?
2. **Pattern Evolution**: Which patterns proved most valuable?
3. **Process Refinement**: What process changes had most impact?
4. **Tool Optimization**: Which tools/approaches work best?
