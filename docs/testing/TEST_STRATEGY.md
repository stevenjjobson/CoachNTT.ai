# Testing Strategy and Coverage Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for CoachNTT.ai, ensuring high code quality, safety validation, and system reliability.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Safety-First**: All tests must validate safety abstractions and prevent concrete references
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >90% code coverage across all modules
- **Performance Validation**: Critical paths must meet performance targets
- **E2E Scenarios**: Test complete user workflows from start to finish

## Test Execution Strategy

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/                    # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/             # Integration tests
pytest tests/e2e/                     # E2E tests
pytest -m performance                 # Performance tests
pytest -m safety                      # Safety tests

# Coverage reporting
pytest --cov=src --cov=cli --cov-report=html
```

### Continuous Integration

- **Coverage**: 100% of user-generated content

### Concrete Reference Detection
- **Scope**: All text content, prompts, and metadata
- **Patterns**: API keys, URLs, file paths, personal information
- **Action**: Fail fast on detection

### Safety Score Validation
- **Requirement**: All content must achieve minimum safety scores
- **Thresholds**: >0.8 for production content
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unsafe pattern library

## Test Maintenance

### Test Data Management
- Regular fixture updates
- Performance baseline updates
- Safety pattern library expansion
- Test data anonymization

### Test Review Process
- All new features require corresponding tests
- Test coverage must not decrease
- Performance tests must validate against targets
- Safety tests must cover new abstraction patterns

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Coverage Reporting
- Codecov integration for coverage tracking
- Coverage reports in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage trends and regression detection

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance baseline tracking
- Regression detection and alerting
- Performance report artifacts

### Test Metrics
- Test execution time trends
- Flaky test identification
- Test reliability metrics

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
2. **Single Responsibility**: One assertion per test when possible
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
4. **Independent Tests**: No dependencies between tests
5. **Realistic Data**: Use realistic test data and scenarios

### Safety Testing
1. **Comprehensive Patterns**: Test all known unsafe patterns
2. **Edge Cases**: Include boundary conditions and malformed input
3. **Performance**: Validate abstraction performance under load
4. **Regression**: Prevent previously caught issues from reoccurring

### Performance Testing
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Set clear performance baselines
2. **Load Variation**: Test under different load conditions
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory, CPU, and I/O usage
4. **Regression Prevention**: Fail builds on performance regressions
