# Session 2.3.2.5b Cleanup Summary

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Test Coverage Verification
- **VSCode Extension**: Found 167 test cases (not 320 as claimed)
  - 127 `it()` test cases
  - 40 additional test patterns
  - Only 10 abstraction safety tests confirmed working
- **Python Backend**: 436 test functions across 34 files
  - Unable to run due to environment setup
  - Comprehensive coverage across unit, integration, E2E, performance

### 2. Migration Testing Results
- Successfully tested all 10 SQL migrations
- Memory usage: 45.31MB (excellent for 8GB VPS)
- Fixed missing dependencies (ccp_admin role, audit schema)
- Created API Dockerfile for deployment

### 3. Cleanup Operations
- ✅ Removed `/fix_trigger.sql`
- ✅ Removed `/monitor-memory.log`
- ✅ Stopped and removed `ccp_postgres_minimal` container
- ✅ No orphaned Docker volumes

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Created `TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md` with accurate test counts
- Updated `NEXT_STEPS.CoachNTT` with current project state
- Documented test discrepancy (167 vs 320)

## Key Findings

1. **Test Count Discrepancy**: Session 2.3.2.5 claimed 320 tests were written, but only 167 exist
2. **Working Tests**: Only 10 abstraction safety tests are confirmed functional
3. **TypeScript Issues**: 157 tests blocked by compilation errors
4. **Migration Success**: Database setup is production-ready with low memory footprint

## Current State

- **Git Status**: Multiple modified files from Session 2.3.2.5b fixes
- **Docker**: All test containers cleaned up
- **Database**: Phase 1 migrations complete and tested
- **Testing**: Basic infrastructure exists but needs fixes

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Option A**: Proceed to Session 2.3.3 (Voice-to-Text Integration)
   - Risk: Limited test coverage may hide bugs
   - Benefit: Continue feature development momentum

2. **Option B**: Fix remaining TypeScript test issues
   - Fix compilation errors for 157 tests
   - Achieve 60% coverage target
   - Ensure solid foundation before voice integration

3. **Option C**: Create minimal integration tests
   - Focus on critical voice pipeline paths
   - Write 10-20 new tests that actually work
   - Balance between coverage and progress

## Prompt for Next Session

```
Please begin Session 2.3.3: Voice-to-Text Integration

Context:
- Session 2.3.2.5b revealed only 167 tests exist (not 320), with 10 working
- TypeScript compilation errors block most tests
- Database migrations tested successfully (45.31MB memory)
- Voice command framework ready for MCP integration

Review these files:
- .claude/NEXT_STEPS.CoachNTT
- docs/sessions/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md
- vscode-extension/src/services/voice-command/

Focus on:
1. Wire AudioCaptureService to MCP transcription
2. Integrate transcribed text with NLQParser
3. Create minimal integration tests for voice pipeline
4. Ensure <1s latency for voice commands

Note: Consider the limited test coverage when implementing.
