## 📚 Module 1: Understanding Context Windows

### 1.1 What is a Context Window?

The context window is the total amount of information an AI can process in a single conversation. Think of it as the AI's "working memory."

**Key Concepts**:
- Fixed size (varies by model)
- Includes all conversation history
- Consumes tokens for both input and output
- Cannot be extended mid-conversation

### 1.2 Token-to-Code Ratios

Different content types consume context at different rates:

| Content Type | Tokens per 1000 lines | Example |
|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| Simple Code | 800-1000 | Config files, data |
| Complex Code | 1500-2000 | Business logic |
| SQL | 1200-1500 | Database schemas |
| Tests | 1000-1500 | Unit tests |
| Documentation | 500-800 | Markdown files |

### 📝 Exercise 1.1: Estimate Your Context

Given a task to create:
- 500 lines of Python code
- 200 lines of tests
- 100 lines of documentation

Calculate the estimated token consumption.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- Python: 500 × 1.5 = 750 tokens
- Tests: 200 × 1.2 = 240 tokens  
- Docs: 100 × 0.6 = 60 tokens
- **Total: ~1,050 tokens**

</details>

## 📊 Module 2: Progress Tracking Patterns

### 2.1 The Progress Indicator System

Use these indicators naturally in your development:

```
✅ Component Complete - Major task finished
📊 Context Update - Current usage estimate
🎯 Next Target - What's coming next
💡 Checkpoint Opportunity - Good time to save
```

### 2.2 Session Start Protocol

Always begin with a context plan:

```markdown
## Session X.X Context Plan
**Estimated Output**: ~1500 lines
**Context Budget**: ~60% of window
**Commit Points**: 
- [ ] Models complete
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Documentation added
```

### 📝 Exercise 2.1: Create a Session Plan

Plan a session to implement a user authentication system with:
- User model (100 lines)
- Auth service (300 lines)
- Tests (200 lines)
- API endpoints (200 lines)

<details>
<summary>Solution Template</summary>

```markdown
## Auth System Context Plan
**Estimated Output**: ~800 lines
**Context Budget**: ~50% of window (conservative)
**Commit Points**:
- [ ] User model complete
- [ ] Auth service implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] API endpoints working

**Progress Milestones**:
- 25%: Model done
- 50%: Service complete
- 75%: Tests written
- 90%: Documentation
```

</details>

## 🚨 Module 3: Crisis Prevention

### 3.1 Warning Signs

Recognize these early indicators:

1. **Output Verbosity**: Responses getting longer
2. **File Repetition**: Reading same files multiple times
3. **Scope Creep**: "Just one more feature"
4. **Test Explosion**: Comprehensive tests too early

### 3.2 The 60% Rule

At 60% context consumption:
- ✅ Assess remaining work
- ✅ Consider checkpoint commit
- ✅ Prioritize essentials
- ❌ Don't add new features

### 3.3 Recovery Strategies

If approaching limits:

```markdown
1. STOP adding features
2. ENSURE code works
3. MINIMAL documentation
4. COMMIT immediately
5. PLAN continuation
```

### 📝 Exercise 3.1: Crisis Response

You're at 85% context, with:
- Feature 90% complete
- No tests written
- No documentation

What do you do?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. **Complete feature** to working state (5%)
2. **Write 2-3 critical tests** (8%)
3. **Add inline comments** only (2%)
4. **Commit with descriptive message**
5. **Note what's missing** for next session

Total: 100% - Crisis averted!

## 📈 Module 4: Efficiency Patterns

### 4.1 High-Efficiency Patterns

**Pattern A: Batch Similar Work**
```python
# Efficient: Create all models together
class User: ...
class Post: ...
class Comment: ...

# Then all validators together
class UserValidator: ...
class PostValidator: ...
```

**Pattern B: Reference Don't Repeat**
```markdown
"Implement PostService following the same pattern as UserService"
vs
"Create PostService with [full explanation repeated]"
```

### 4.2 Context Wasters to Avoid

1. **The Perfectionist**
   - Writing comprehensive tests immediately
   - Over-documenting simple code
   - Refactoring during implementation

2. **The Explorer**
   - Reading entire codebases
   - Checking multiple implementation options
   - Researching without deciding

### 📝 Exercise 4.1: Optimize This Session

Given this inefficient approach:
1. Read entire codebase
2. Implement feature
3. Write all edge case tests
4. Refactor for performance
5. Write detailed docs

Reorganize for efficiency.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Optimized Approach**:
1. Read only relevant files (targeted)
2. Implement core feature
3. Write essential tests only
4. Commit working version
5. (Next session): Edge cases, refactoring, detailed docs

Saves ~40% context!

## 📊 Module 5: Session Analysis

### 5.1 The Analysis Framework

After each major section:

```markdown
## Analysis Components
1. Metrics - What happened?
2. Challenges - What was hard?
3. Learnings - What did we discover?
4. Improvements - What to change?
```

### 5.2 Calculating Efficiency

```
Context Efficiency = (Useful Output / Total Context) × 100

Example:
- Created 1000 lines of code
- Used 2000 tokens
- Efficiency: 50%
```

### 5.3 Continuous Improvement

Track trends over time:
- Is efficiency improving?
- Are crisis moments decreasing?
- Is code quality maintained?

### 📝 Exercise 5.1: Analyze a Session

Given:
- Planned: 1000 lines
- Created: 1500 lines  
- Context: 95% used
- Had to skip tests

Write an analysis.

<details>
<summary>Sample Analysis</summary>

```markdown
## Session Analysis

### What Happened
- 50% over estimate (poor planning)
- Nearly exhausted context
- Skipped testing (technical debt)

### Root Cause
- Underestimated complexity
- No checkpoint at 60%
- Tried to complete everything

### Improvements
1. Add 50% buffer to estimates
2. Mandatory checkpoint at 60%
3. Core features only first pass
```

</details>

*Remember: The goal isn't to use less context, it's to deliver more value per context unit.*
