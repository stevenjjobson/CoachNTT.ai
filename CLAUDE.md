  - All infrastructure ready for Phase 1 continuation

- **Session 1.2**: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup
  - Created security-hardened PostgreSQL Dockerfile with comprehensive protection
  - Enhanced docker-compose.yml with advanced security configurations
  - Built safety-first database schema with safety tables created FIRST
  - Implemented comprehensive validation triggers preventing concrete references
  - Configured secure PgBouncer connection pooling with monitoring
  - Created AES-256 encrypted backup/restore system with safety validation
  - Established comprehensive audit logging with real-time security monitoring
  - Built 25-test safety enforcement validation suite
  - Database infrastructure now production-ready with zero-tolerance safety enforcement

- **Session 1.3**: Safety-First Database Schema
  - Created 7 SQL migrations (004-010) implementing comprehensive safety enforcement
  - Built Python memory models with mandatory abstraction validation
  - Created 75-test validation suite ensuring zero-tolerance for concrete references
  - Implemented advanced validation functions for all content types
  - Added real-time safety scoring system with automatic quarantine
  - Created abstraction quality assurance with 6 quality dimensions
  - Built 30+ specialized indexes for safety-aware performance
  - Set up automatic detection system for continuous monitoring
  - All components enforce minimum safety score of 0.8

### 🔑 Key Design Decisions
1. **Mandatory Abstraction**: All concrete references must be abstracted (min score 0.8)
2. **Placeholder Format**: `<placeholder_name>` (configurable)
3. **Multi-stage Validation**: Input → Abstraction → Storage → Retrieval
4. **Database Enforcement**: Safety rules enforced at PostgreSQL level

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Run tests
./run_tests.py

# Connect to database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U ccp_user -d cognitive_coding_partner
```

## 📋 Next Session Plan

### Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation (Lines 244-276)
**Prerequisites**: Session 1.3 complete ✅  
**Focus**: Complete memory model implementation with safety

**Key Tasks**:
- [ ] Review existing Python memory models (created in Session 1.3)
- [ ] Enhance AbstractMemoryEntry with additional features
- [ ] Implement memory decay algorithms
- [ ] Create memory clustering system
- [ ] Build similarity search functionality
- [ ] Add temporal relationship tracking
- [ ] Implement memory reinforcement patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Test end-to-end memory pipeline
- [ ] Validate all safety measures working

**Files to Load**:
1. This file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 244-276 for Session 1.4)
3. src/core/memory/ (existing models from Session 1.3)
4. Recent migration files for context

## 🎯 How to Start Next Session

```
I'm continuing work on CoachNTT.ai. We completed Session 1.3 (Safety-First Database Schema).

Please review:
1. @CLAUDE.md
2. @Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 244-276 for Session 1.4)
3. @src/core/memory/ (models created in Session 1.3)
4. @migrations/005_cognitive_memory_enhancements.sql (for memory table structure)

Ready to start Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation.

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Phase 0: Safety Foundation [▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100% (3/3 sessions) ✅
- Phase 1: Secure Foundation [▓▓▓▓▓ ] 75% (3/4 sessions)
- Phase 2: Intelligence Layer [ ] 0%
- Phase 3: Knowledge Integration [ ] 0%
- Phase 4: Integration & Polish [ ] 0%

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Context Window**: Keep initial load under 3000 tokens
- **Progressive Loading**: Start minimal, load files as needed
- **Safety First**: Every feature must support abstraction from the start
- **No Retrofitting**: Build safety into foundation, not added later
