# 🧠 CoachNTT.ai - AI Context & Session Management

## 🎯 Project Overview
**What**: Cognitive Coding Partner - AI development assistant with temporal memory  
**Core Feature**: Safety-first abstraction of all concrete references  
**Tech Stack**: Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL with pgvector, FastAPI  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Secure Foundation (In Progress)

## 📍 Current State (Updated: 2025-01-13)

### ✅ Completed Sessions
- **Session 0.1**: Core Safety Principles & Architecture
  - Created safety documentation (PRINCIPLES.md, PATTERNS.md, VALIDATION.md)
  - Implemented abstraction engine with 4 core components
  - Set up PostgreSQL + pgvector in Docker
  - Created comprehensive test suite
  - Database migration: `000_safety_foundation.sql`

- **Session 0.2**: Safety Database Schema
  - Created validation triggers to enforce abstraction at DB level
  - Implemented row-level security (RLS) policies
  - Added advanced check constraints for safety
  - Created temporal safety functions
  - Enhanced audit logging with comprehensive triggers
  - Database migration: `001_safety_enforcement.sql`
  - Created SQL and Python test suites

- **Session 0.3**: Reference Abstraction Framework
  - Enhanced abstraction rules for all reference types (variables, APIs, cloud, etc.)
  - Created comprehensive memory validation pipeline with 5 stages
  - Built safety metrics collection with real-time monitoring
  - Implemented abstraction quality scorer with 6 quality dimensions
  - Added comprehensive test suite with integration tests
  - All components tested and working: safety score 0.995, processing <1ms

- **Session 1.1**: Safety-First Project Initialization
  - Created production-ready project structure with safety built-in
  - Enhanced all configuration files with safety-first approach
  - Updated README.md with safety principles prominent
  - Added comprehensive security dependencies and tooling
  - Initialized vault with safety templates and structure
  - Configured pre-commit hooks for safety validation
  - All infrastructure ready for Phase 1 continuation

- **Session 1.2**: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup
  - Created security-hardened PostgreSQL Dockerfile with comprehensive protection
  - Enhanced docker-compose.yml with advanced security configurations
  - Built safety-first database schema with safety tables created FIRST
  - Implemented comprehensive validation triggers preventing concrete references
  - Configured secure PgBouncer connection pooling with monitoring
  - Created AES-256 encrypted backup/restore system with safety validation
  - Established comprehensive audit logging with real-time security monitoring
  - Built 25-test safety enforcement validation suite
  - Database infrastructure now production-ready with zero-tolerance safety enforcement

```

### 🔑 Key Design Decisions
1. **Mandatory Abstraction**: All concrete references must be abstracted (min score 0.8)
2. **Placeholder Format**: `<placeholder_name>` (configurable)
3. **Multi-stage Validation**: Input → Abstraction → Storage → Retrieval
4. **Database Enforcement**: Safety rules enforced at PostgreSQL level

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Run tests
./run_tests.py

# Connect to database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U ccp_user -d cognitive_coding_partner
```

## 📋 Next Session Plan

### Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema (Lines 203-241)
**Prerequisites**: Session 1.2 complete ✅  
**Focus**: Every table enforces abstraction from database level

**Key Tasks**:
- [ ] Create abstraction enforcement tables FIRST
- [ ] Create cognitive_memory with mandatory abstraction
- [ ] Add safety validations to all tables
- [ ] Create reference validation functions
- [ ] Implement safety scoring triggers
- [ ] Add abstraction quality checks
- [ ] Create safety-aware indexes
- [ ] Set up automatic reference detection
- [ ] Test rejection of concrete-only data
- [ ] Validate abstraction enforced at DB level

**Files to Load**:
1. This file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 203-241 for Session 1.3)
3. Current database migrations and safety schema
4. Existing safety validation components

## 🎯 How to Start Next Session

```
I'm continuing work on CoachNTT.ai. We completed Session 1.2 (Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup).

Please review:
1. @CLAUDE.md
2. @Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 203-241 for Session 1.3)
3. Current database migrations and safety schema
4. @migrations/ (existing safety validation components)

Ready to start Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema.

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Phase 0: Safety Foundation [▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100% (3/3 sessions) ✅
- Phase 1: Secure Foundation [▓▓▓   ] 50% (2/4 sessions)
- Phase 2: Intelligence Layer [ ] 0%
- Phase 3: Knowledge Integration [ ] 0%
- Phase 4: Integration & Polish [ ] 0%

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Context Window**: Keep initial load under 3000 tokens
- **Progressive Loading**: Start minimal, load files as needed
- **Safety First**: Every feature must support abstraction from the start
- **No Retrofitting**: Build safety into foundation, not added later
