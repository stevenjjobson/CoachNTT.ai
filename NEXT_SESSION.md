# 🚀 Next Session Quick Start

## Session 1.2: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup

### Copy this to start the next session:
```
I'm continuing work on CoachNTT.ai. We completed Session 1.1 (Safety-First Project Initialization).

Please review:
1. @CLAUDE.md
2. @Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 167-202 for Session 1.2)
3. Current Docker setup for enhancement
4. @migrations/ (existing safety schema components)

Ready to start Session 1.2: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup.
```

### Pre-Session Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Session 1.1 completion: All safety infrastructure ready
- [ ] Check Docker setup: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Verify current PostgreSQL setup: `docker/dockerfiles/postgres.Dockerfile`
- [ ] Review existing migrations: `migrations/000_safety_foundation.sql`, `migrations/001_safety_enforcement.sql`
- [ ] Check safety components ready: Test abstraction framework
- [ ] Commit Session 1.1 work if not already done

### Session Goals:
1. Create secure PostgreSQL Dockerfile with hardening
2. Update docker-compose.yml with enhanced security settings
3. Create secure database initialization scripts
4. Write safety-first schema with safety tables first
5. Add validation triggers from the start
6. Configure secure connection pooling and backup

### What Changed in Session 1.1:
- ✅ Created production-ready project structure with safety built-in
- ✅ Enhanced all configuration files with safety-first approach
- ✅ Updated README.md with safety principles prominent
- ✅ Added comprehensive security dependencies and tooling
- ✅ Initialized vault with safety templates and structure
- ✅ Configured pre-commit hooks for safety validation
- ✅ All infrastructure ready for Phase 1 continuation

### Phase 1 Progress 🚀
**Secure Foundation (25% complete)**:
- Session 1.1: Safety-First Project Initialization ✅
- Session 1.2: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup ⏳
- Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema (next)
- Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation (next)

**Key Achievements So Far**:
- Complete safety-first development infrastructure
- Comprehensive security tooling and validation
- Production-ready project structure
- Enhanced Docker configuration with security defaults

### Remember:
- Database must enforce abstraction from start
- Safety tables must exist before memory tables
- All triggers and validations from the beginning
- Test with invalid data to ensure rejection

### Current Architecture Status:
```
Infrastructure:         ✅ Complete (Session 1.1)
├── Project Structure   ✅ Safety-first directories
├── Security Tools      ✅ Comprehensive scanning
├── Pre-commit Hooks    ✅ Safety validation
└── Configuration       ✅ Production-ready

Next: Secure database setup with safety enforcement
