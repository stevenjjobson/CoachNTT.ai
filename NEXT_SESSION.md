# 🚀 Next Session Quick Start

## Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema

### Copy this to start the next session:
```
I'm continuing work on CoachNTT.ai. We completed Session 1.2 (Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup).

Please review:
1. @CLAUDE.md
2. @Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 203-241 for Session 1.3)
3. Current database migrations and safety schema
4. @migrations/ (existing safety validation components)

Ready to start Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema.
```

### Pre-Session Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Session 1.2 completion: Secure database infrastructure ready
- [ ] Check Docker setup: `docker-compose ps` (PostgreSQL + PgBouncer)
- [ ] Verify database security: All migrations applied and triggers active
- [ ] Review existing safety schema: `migrations/002_safety_first_schema.sql`, `migrations/003_safety_validation_triggers.sql`
- [ ] Test safety enforcement: Run `scripts/database/test-safety-enforcement.sh`
- [ ] Commit Session 1.2 work if not already done

### Session Goals:
1. Create abstraction enforcement tables FIRST
2. Create cognitive_memory with mandatory abstraction references
3. Add comprehensive safety validations to all tables
4. Create reference validation functions and quality checks
5. Implement safety scoring triggers and automatic detection
6. Create safety-aware indexes for performance
7. Test rejection of concrete-only data
8. Validate abstraction enforced at database level

### What Changed in Session 1.2:
- ✅ Created security-hardened PostgreSQL Dockerfile with comprehensive protection
- ✅ Enhanced docker-compose.yml with advanced security configurations  
- ✅ Built safety-first database schema with safety tables created FIRST
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive validation triggers preventing concrete references
- ✅ Configured secure PgBouncer connection pooling with monitoring
- ✅ Created AES-256 encrypted backup/restore system with safety validation
- ✅ Established comprehensive audit logging with real-time security monitoring
- ✅ Built 25-test safety enforcement validation suite
- ✅ Database infrastructure now production-ready with zero-tolerance safety enforcement

### Phase 1 Progress 🚀
**Secure Foundation (50% complete)**:
- Session 1.1: Safety-First Project Initialization ✅
- Session 1.2: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup ✅
- Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema ⏳
- Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation (next)

**Key Achievements So Far**:
- Complete safety-first development infrastructure
- Security-hardened PostgreSQL with comprehensive protection
- Zero-tolerance safety enforcement at database level
- Encrypted backup/restore with safety validation
- Real-time security monitoring and audit logging
- Comprehensive safety testing and validation

### Remember for Session 1.3:
- Every table must enforce abstraction from database level
- Safety validations built into all database operations
- Reference validation functions must catch all concrete patterns
- Abstraction quality checks mandatory for all data
- Test comprehensive rejection of concrete-only data

### Current Architecture Status:
