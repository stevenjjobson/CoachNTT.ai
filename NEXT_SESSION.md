# 🚀 Next Session Quick Start

## Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation

### Copy this to start the next session:
```
I'm continuing work on CoachNTT.ai. We completed Session 1.3 (Safety-First Database Schema).

Please review:
1. @CLAUDE.md
2. @Implementation_Cadence.md (lines 244-276 for Session 1.4)
3. @src/core/memory/ (models created in Session 1.3)
4. @migrations/005_cognitive_memory_enhancements.sql (for memory table structure)

Ready to start Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation.
```

### Pre-Session Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Session 1.3 completion: Safety-first database schema complete
- [ ] Check Docker setup: `docker-compose ps` (PostgreSQL + PgBouncer running)
- [ ] Verify all 10 migrations applied: `migrations/001-010_*.sql`
- [ ] Review Python models: `src/core/memory/abstract_models.py`, `validator.py`, `repository.py`
- [ ] Test safety enforcement: Run `scripts/database/test-abstraction-enforcement.sql`
- [ ] Commit Session 1.3 work if not already done

### Session Goals:
1. Review existing Python memory models (created ahead in Session 1.3)
2. Enhance AbstractMemoryEntry with decay algorithms
3. Implement temporal relationship tracking between memories
4. Create memory clustering system for grouping related content
5. Build similarity search with vector embeddings
6. Add memory reinforcement based on usage patterns
7. Create comprehensive integration tests
8. Validate end-to-end safety enforcement

### What Changed in Session 1.3:
- ✅ Created 7 SQL migrations (004-010) implementing comprehensive safety enforcement
- ✅ Built Python memory models with mandatory abstraction validation
- ✅ Created 75-test validation suite ensuring zero-tolerance for concrete references
- ✅ Implemented advanced validation functions for all content types
- ✅ Added real-time safety scoring system with automatic quarantine
- ✅ Created abstraction quality assurance with 6 quality dimensions
- ✅ Built 30+ specialized indexes for safety-aware performance
- ✅ Set up automatic detection system for continuous monitoring
- ✅ All components enforce minimum safety score of 0.8

### Phase 1 Progress 🚀
**Secure Foundation (75% complete)**:
- Session 1.1: Safety-First Project Initialization ✅
- Session 1.2: Secure PostgreSQL & pgvector Setup ✅
- Session 1.3: Safety-First Database Schema ✅
- Session 1.4: Abstract Memory Model Implementation ⏳

**Key Achievements So Far**:
- Complete safety-first development infrastructure
- Security-hardened PostgreSQL with comprehensive protection
- Zero-tolerance safety enforcement at database level
- Python memory models with mandatory abstraction
- 75-test validation suite for safety enforcement
- Real-time scoring and automatic quarantine system
- Comprehensive abstraction quality assurance
- Performance-optimized safety-aware indexes

### Remember for Session 1.4:
- Python models already exist from Session 1.3 - enhance, don't recreate
- Focus on advanced features: decay, clustering, similarity search
- All new features must maintain safety-first approach
- Minimum safety score of 0.8 remains mandatory
- Integration tests should cover full pipeline
